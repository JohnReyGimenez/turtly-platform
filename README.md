**Turtly** is an educational platform that combines a visual programming app with easy-to-assemble robotics kits. Designed for lower primary students and private schools, it helps young learners explore their creativity, problem-solving, and engineering through play.

## Project Goals

- Teach basic programming to kids using a block-based app (like Scratch)
- Support a low-cost, snap-together robot kit controlled via Bluetooth
- Create a seamless web and mobile experience

## Features (Planned)

- Drag-and-drop block coding interface
- Bluetooth robot control with Arduino
- Save & load projects in the cloud
- Teacher dashboard for managing student progress
- Downloadable learning materials

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native or Expo (Mobile)
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails API
- **Hardware**: Arduino + Bluetooth + 3D-printed robot kit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Self-hosted on VPS
